# BCBL
This is mostly a joke. I had to create business cards and was given by the university a form that restricted the layout and number of characters. I decided to have fun and wrote on my cards a little implementation of propositional logic in the SK calculus, a sort of business card boolean logic (BCBL) if you will. Then I decided to see if I could actually implement it in Haskell. It was fun!

## Are there any good ideas in here?

No, probably not.
